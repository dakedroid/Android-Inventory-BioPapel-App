# Android-Inventory-BioPapel-App

Biopapel Iventory App: This Android mobile Application have been writtin in Java and XML using the IDE Android Studio.
This application is just for learning, you can downloaded and use it as you want. it contains many features. You can Generate
a QR Code and Store it into Server with a SQL database. This Server could be a RESTFUL API. i have a repo with the original Server code writtin in PHP without any framework and this could be insecure. I recommend to create a new one.
This application also can read QR Codes and a search  them on the database  printing all information of what represents that code in the inventory
